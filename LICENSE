## Preamble

The **GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)** is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. It is specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

Most software licenses are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the software. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program—to ensure the software remains free for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we refer to **freedom, not price**. The GNU General Public Licenses ensure that you have the freedom to:
- Distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),
- Access the source code or obtain it if you want,
- Modify the software or use parts of it in new free programs,
- Know that you can do these things.

Developers using the GNU General Public Licenses protect your rights by:
1. Asserting copyright on the software, and
2. Offering you this License, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute, and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if widely used, become available for other developers to incorporate. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this may not happen. The **GNU Affero General Public License** addresses this by requiring that the modified source code becomes available to the community when the software is used on a network server.
